His work bridges media from painting and sculpture to video, installation, performance, and sound and has been exhibited at Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary AArt, the Queens Museum, Crystal Bridges Museum of American AArt, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of AArt, the Minneapolis Institute of AArt and the AArt Institute of Chicago.
