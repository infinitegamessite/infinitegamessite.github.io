<!--Artist Bio_Content-->
   <div class="artist_content"><p>Working across a variety of media, Parsons and Charlesworth create objects, exhibits, texts and images that encourage reflection upon the current and future state of our designed culture. The studio uses objects and futures alongside narrative and speculation to prototype new ways of living, often proposing what does not exist yet and asking what if it did ? Founded by British designers Tim Parsons and Jessica Charlesworth as a formal art and design studio in 2014 after years of informal collaboration, Parsons and Charlesworth became the grounding place to explore how issues like climate change, personal survival and happiness can be reconsidered through alternative engagement with everyday objects.</p>

<p>Parsons and Charlesworth have presented and exhibited at Chicago Cultural Center, Arts Club of Chicago, Istanbul Design Biennial, the Museum of Contemporary Art (Chicago), Fernwey Gallery (Chicago), Home (Manchester),  WantedDesign (New York City), Aram Gallery (London) and the London Design Festival. Their work is featured in various private collections and in the permanent collection at the MAKVienna. Previous projects have been reviewed in various publications including the Chicago Tribune, Forbes, Reuters, Icon, Metropolis, Disegno, Domus, New City, Arbitare and Architect Magazine.</p>

<p>Both Tim and Jessica are faculty in the Designed Objects program in the Department of Architecture, Interior Architecture and Designed Objects at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>
