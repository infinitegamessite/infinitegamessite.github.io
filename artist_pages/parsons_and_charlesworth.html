<!--Artist Bio_Content-->
   <div class="artist_content"><p>Working across a variety of media, Parsons & Charlesworth create objects, exhibits, texts and images that encourage reflection upon the current and future state of our designed culture. The studio creates objects and futures using narrative and speculation to prototype new ways of living, often proposing what does not exist yet and asking what if it did ?Founded by designers Tim Parsons and Jessica Charlesworth as a formal art and design studio in 2014 after years of informal collaboration, Parsons and Charlesworth became the grounding place to explore how issues like climate change, personal survival and happiness can be reconsidered through alternative engagement with everyday objects.</p>
