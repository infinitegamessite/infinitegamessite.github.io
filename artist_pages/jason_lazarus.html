<!--Artist Bio_Content-->
   <div class="artist_content"><p> Jason Lazarus (born 1975) is a Florida based artist, curator, educator, and writer. Working at the intersection of expanded photography and community engagement, Lazarus’ work seeks experiential forms and methods to grapple with the politics of representation. </p>

<p>Since 2003, Lazarus’ practice has grown to include multiple archive projects, installation, sculpture, a feature length film featuring over 3000 animated gifs, an online arts criticism platform, an alternative exhibition space called Coco Hunday in Tampa, Florida, and the itinerant sculpture-text library PDF-OBJECTS among other projects. 
Lazarus’ work has recently been examined by Christopher Knight (LA Times), Michelle Grabner (monograph published by University Galleries of Illinois State University), Lori Waxman (Artforum), Abigail Solomon-Godeau (monograph published by SF Camerawork), Shane Lavalette (monograph published by Light Work), and Carmen Winant (Frieze). </p>

<p>Recent solo exhibitions include Chicago Works: Jason Lazarus at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, Live Archive at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco, The Rickshaw at Andrew Rafacz Gallery (Chicago) and THTK (Toronto) at Gallery TPW in Toronto, CA. </p>

<p>Major exhibitions include About Time: Photography in a Moment of Change at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Love to Love You at MASS MoCA, On the Scene at the Art Institute of Chicago, Black Is, Black Ain’t at the Renaissance Society, Not the Way You Remembered at the Queens Museum of Art, Photography and Objecthood in the Digital Age at the George Eastman Museum, Image Search at PPOW Gallery in NYC, Way of the Shovel at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, and Michael Jackson Doesn’t Quit, Part 3 at the Future Gallery, Berlin. </p>

<p>His project Phase 1 Live Archive is featured on the cover of A Political Economy of the Senses: Neoliberalism, Reification, Critique by Anita Chari (Columbia University Press, 2015). In the summer of 2017, he will be a Resident Artist at the Hunter East Harlem Gallery in Harlem, NYC and in the fall of 2017 will co-present PDF-Objects at Exgirlfriend in Berlin, Germany. </p>
