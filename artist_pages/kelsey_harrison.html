<!--Artist Bio_Content-->
   <div class="artist_content"><p>Kelsey Harrison was born in California in 1989. She received her BFA in Sculpture from Purchase College, State University of New York in 2014. Harrison is a second year graduate student in Sculpture at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Her work investigates the potential for (and in) misrecognition of convention and form through abstraction, subversion of convention, repetition, and displacement of objects and actors in space. Her work has been shown in institutions nationally including The Jewish Museum, Abrons Art Center, and The Knockown Center in New York, SOMArts in San Francisco, and The College of William and Mary in Virginia. She was the recipient of the PSGA Public Art Grant at SUNY Purchase, and was a 2014-15 resident at Brooklyn Wayfarers Studio Residency, as well as the School of Making Thinking, and Peters Valley.</p>
