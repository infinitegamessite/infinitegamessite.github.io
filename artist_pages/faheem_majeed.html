<!--Artist Bio_Content-->
   <div class="artist_content"><p>Faheem Majeed (American, b. 1976) is a builder—literally and metaphorically. A resident of the South Shore neighborhood in Chicago, Majeed often looks to the material makeup of his neighborhood and surrounding areas as an entry point into larger questions around civic-mindedness, community activism, and institutional racism. As part of his studio practice, the artist transforms materials such as particle board, scrap metal and wood, and discarded signs and billboard remnants, breathing new life into these often overlooked and devalued materials. His broader engagement with the arts also involves arts administration, curation, and community facilitation, all which feed into his larger practice.</p>
 
<p>Majeed received his BFA from Howard University and his MFA from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). </p>
 
<p>From 2005-2011, Majeed served as Executive Director and Curator for the South Side Community Art Center (SSCAC).  In this role he was responsible for managing operations, staff, programs, fundraising, curation, and archives for the SSCAC. During his time with the SSCAC, Majeed curated exhibitions of numerous artists including Elizabeth Catlett, Dr. David Driskell, Charles White, Jonathan Green, and Theaster Gates.</p>
 
<p>Majeed was selected as the inaugural artist in residence for University of Chicago’s Arts in Public Life Initiative (2012), MANA Contemporary Chicago (2014), and Chicago’s Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (2015).</p>
 
<p>From 2013 – 2015 he served as the associate director and faculty of UIC’s School of Art and Art History.  While at UIC he taught classes in museum collections and socially engaged art practices.</p>
