   <div class="artist_content"><p> Sabina Ott is known for her broad range of work-- from painting to installation to sculpture-- and her central role in the art world as teacher, administrator, and as the founder of the exhibition space Terrain, which invites artists to create installations and performances using the exterior of her Oak Park home. She earned both her BFA and MFA from the San Francisco Art Institute. Exhibiting since 1985, Ott has participated in over 100 solo and group exhibitions at institutions in Sao Paulo, Brazil; Auckland, New Zealand; Melbourne, Australia; and many cities across the US. Her work is in numerous museum collections including The Whitney Museum of American Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Oakland Museum of Art, and has been reviewed in Art in America, Art Forum, New Art Examiner, The New York Ties and The Los Angeles Times, among other publications. She has received a Guggenheim fellowship for 2015-2016 and recently held solo exhibitions at the Chicago Cultural Center and the Hyde Park Art Center.
