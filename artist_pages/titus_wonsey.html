<!--Artist Bio_Content-->
   <div class="artist_content"><p>I am invested in learning how “to be.” I investigate the subtle, important and/or common details that are hidden in plain sight in the environments that surround us. Employing different processes to highlight these things in order to affect how we see beauty. My source material is in surplus. I use industrial building materials such as wood and brick because of their commonality. These materials are apart of our everyday environment and are easily recognizable. As conditioned consumers, our definition of beauty is too often dictated by the object’s exclusivity. By using common materials I hope to slow us down a bit, giving us space to reimagine, decontextualize and appreciate things that are all around us.</p>

<p>Many of the pieces that I construct, scenes, objects etc. aim to create continuity between environments that may regularly contrast, in order to better connect audiences to each other. My work intends to complicate their interactions by creating a sort of translation. I look to learn what sensitivity is in different environments, in order to facilitate in the communication of that sensitivity to a different audience. If certain intricacies of a particular environment can be communicated to another, it allows for a greater connection to be realized and/or created.</p>

<p>Investigating the relationship between activity and identity has led me to physically involve myself in different environments, performing different tasks. My kinetic involvement enhances my ability to identify and/or communicate the meaning behind the movement. I look to understand the exchanges that happen within work environments and how they produce more than objects and resource.</p>
