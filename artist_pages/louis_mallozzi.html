<p>A telescope inside the third-floor apartment at OHC is trained on a distant rooftop.
There, visible only through the telescope, is a construction made from discarded CPS
furniture. The piece offers a view separated by distance but collapsed by optics,
focused on a tiny point in the complex urban cityscape.</p>
