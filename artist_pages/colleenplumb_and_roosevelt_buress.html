     <!--Artist Bio_Content-->
   <div class="artist_content_long"><p>Colleen Plumb (American, born Chicago, IL, 1970) makes photographs, videos, objects, and public video projections investigating contradictory relationships people have with animals. Her recent projects explore the way animals in captivity function as symbols of persistent colonial thinking, that a striving for human domination over nature has been normalized, and that consumption masks as curiosity. Plumb's work sheds light on abnormal behaviors of captive animals in order to bring attention to implicit values of society as a whole, particularly those that perpetuate power imbalance and tyranny of artifice. By projecting videos on the street, strangers connect as witnesses and contribute to the idea that sentient beings are not meant for spectacle or display.</p>

<p>Plumb's work is held in several permanent collections and has been widely exhibited, including the Portland Art Museum, Milwaukee Art Museum, Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago, Blue Sky Oregon Center for the Photographic Arts in Portland, Dina Mitrani Gallery  and The Screening Room  in Miami,  Southeast Museum of Photography in Daytona, Jen Bekman Gallery in New York, Union League Club of Chicago, and the Notebaert Nature Museum in Chicago. Her work has been part of The Chicago Project at Catherine Edelman Gallery in Chicago since 2005 and the Midwest Photographers Project at the Museum of Contemporary Photography since 2003. She has written for the Center for Humans and Nature, an organization dedicated  to exploring and promoting human responsibilities in relation to nature, and was a contributor to their newly released book, City Creatures (University of Chicago Press, 2015). Plumb is an Openlands Treekeeper, a Chicago metropolitan conservation organization.</p>

<p>Her first photography monograph, Animals Are Outside Today (Radius Books, 2011) critically documents our ambivalent dispositions towards animals. Her focus for nearly two decades has been an inquiry into a society whose appetite for animals, whether in flesh or in reproduction, with admiration or obsession, is voracious.

Plumb's work has appeared in Virginia Quarterly Review, Village Voice, Blow Photo Magazine, New York Times LENS, Time Lightbox, Oxford American, Photo District News, and Artillery Magazine. Plumb lives in Chicago and has taught photography and video at Columbia College Chicago since 1999.</p>
