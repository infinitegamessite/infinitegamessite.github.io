     <!--Artist Bio_Content-->
   <div class="artist_content">
<p>Colleen Plumb grew up in Rogers Park in Chicago and is a photography, video, and installation artist. Her first photography monograph, Animals Are Outside Today (Radius Books, 2011) critically documents our ambivalent dispositions towards nonhuman animals. Signaling power imbalance and consumption disguised as curiosity, Plumbâ€™s recent public video projection project, Thirty Times a Minute, focuses on the complexities of keeping wild animals in captivity and raises questions about what it means to participate as a spectator.</p>
 
<p>Her work is held in several permanent collections and has been widely exhibited, including the Portland Art Museum, Milwaukee Art Museum, Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago, Blue Sky Oregon Center for the Photographic Arts in Portland, Catherine Edelman Gallery in Chicago, Dina Mitrani Gallery and The Screening Room in Miami, Jen Bekman Gallery in New York, Union League Club of Chicago, Notebaert Nature Museum in Chicago, and Pinyao International Photography Festival, Pinyao, China. Plumb's work has appeared in Virginia Quarterly Review, Village Voice, Blow Photo Magazine, New York Times Lens, Time Lightbox, Oxford American, Photo District News, and Artillery Magazine. Plumb lives in Chicago and has taught photography and video at Columbia College Chicago since 1999.</p>
