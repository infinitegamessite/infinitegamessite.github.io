<!--Artist Bio_Content-->
   <div class="artist_content"><p> Christopher Schanck was born in 1975 and raised in Dallas, Texas.  He received a B.F.A. from the School of Visual Arts in Sculpture in 1999 and an M.F.A in Design from Cranbrook Academy of Art in 2011.  After graduating, he opened his studio in Detriot in 2012.  He is intereseted in materials and processes that are not traditionally associated with luxury, mass-production, or standards of perfection.  Among his best-known works are those that comprise his 'ALUfoil' series, in which industrial and discarded materials are covered in aluminum foil, and then sealed with resin.  His methods characteristically involve both outsider techniques as well as the help in his studio of marginalized members of the Detroit community.</p>
